# Personal Finance Manager with Predictive Analytics

A personal finance management application that allows users to track their income and expenses, categorize their spending, and analyze their financial habits. The app utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to provide predictions and insights into future spending patterns, helping users make informed financial decisions.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login with JWT for API access.
- **Income and Expense Tracking**: Add and categorize income and expenses, set budgets for each category.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize spending trends and categories using charts and graphs.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning models to predict future expenses based on historical data.
- **Budget Alerts**: Notifications when users approach or exceed their budget.
- **Goal Setting**: Set and track financial goals (e.g., saving for a vacation).

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js (React framework for UI)
  - TypeScript (for type safety)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**:
  - Django REST Framework (for API development)
  - Python (for backend logic and machine learning)
- **Machine Learning**:
  - scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (for building predictive models)
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Chart.js or Recharts (for displaying graphs)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Set Up the Project

- **Frontend**: Initialize a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Set up a Django project and configure Django REST Framework for API development.

### 2. User Authentication

- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure API access.

### 3. Expense and Income Tracking

- Create models in Django for income and expenses, including categories (e.g., food, entertainment, bills).
- Develop API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) income and expense records.

### 4. Data Visualization

- Use Chart.js or Recharts to implement visualizations of user spending trends over time.
- Display data in the form of pie charts, bar charts, or line graphs to help users understand their financial habits.

### 5. Predictive Analytics

- Collect historical spending data and train a machine learning model to predict future expenses (e.g., using regression models or time series forecasting).
- Expose an API endpoint to serve predictions to the frontend.

### 6. Budget Alerts

- Implement budget tracking and notify users when they are nearing or exceeding their spending limits in specific categories.

### 7. Goal Setting

- Allow users to set financial goals (e.g., saving for a vacation) and track their progress towards these goals.

### 8. Testing and Deployment

- Test both frontend and backend for functionality and performance.
- Deploy the frontend on Vercel and the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.
